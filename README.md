# 3-layer-basic

This repository contains an implementation of a basic three-layer architecture, using multiple programming languages including Python, C++, Cython, C, and Fortran.

## Project Structure

- **Application Layer (Python)**: This layer handles the user interaction, API requests, and the overall application workflow.
- **Domain Layer (C++)**: This layer contains the core business logic and domain-specific functionality.
- **Infrastructure Layer (C, Cython, Fortran)**: This layer is responsible for low-level operations, such as data persistence and communication with external systems.

## Languages Used

- **Python (89.6%)**: The primary language used for the application layer.
- **C++ (7%)**: Used for business logic and domain-specific functionality.
- **Cython (2.6%)**: Provides C-like performance with the ease of Python.
- **C (0.7%)**: Used for low-level operations.
- **Fortran (0.1%)**: Used for specific computational tasks.
- **JavaScript (0%)**: Placeholder for potential future use.
